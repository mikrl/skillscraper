This project is a web scraper for indeed.ca that enumerates all
possible ngrams over a search and returns the top 20 monograms to quadgrams.

The motivation comes from the difficulty in getting interviews from sending out resumes,
as well as the lack of feedback from companies to unsuccessful applicants.

I hope this project is used in both of these manners:

1. Candidates will find the right words to express their skills and get interviews
2. Candidates will be able to find the most in demand skills and learn them
